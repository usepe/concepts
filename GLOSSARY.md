#### <a href="#long-term-refactoring"></a>Long-Term Refactoring

Kind of a planned refactoring, but that uses the other approaches to break down with a long-term plan in place.

The best of it is that let you pivot if needed, and learn from each gradual step.

## P

#### <a href="#planned-refactoring"></a> Planned Refactoring

Refactoring that takes place on code that was leaved unmantained, or without applying refactoring, for long period of times and is included in the agenda of changes as "Need to refactor this".

It is a good advice to not do this kind of refactorings unless they cannot be avoided, as they are hard to justify.

Refactoring that takes place to add a new feature when the existent code base is not a good fit.
